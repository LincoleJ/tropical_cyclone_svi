# Long-Term Social Vulnerability Changes After Tropical Cyclones in the United States

This is the data repository for publicly available code and data to conduct analyses in the paper titled "Long-Term Social Vulnerability Changes After Tropical Cyclones in the United States."

We use a synthetic control approach to analyze fourteen years of tropical cyclone exposure data across contiguous U.S., and provide evidence that tropical cyclone exposures first induces a spike in social vulnerability immediately after tropical cyclones, but over time, affected regions tend to recover and experience gentrification, leaning toward lower social vulnerability compared to similar regions not affected by tropical cyclones.
